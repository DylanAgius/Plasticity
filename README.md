This is still a working progress but what will be contained here is a capbility for 1d continuum plasticity incorporating kinematic and isotropic hardening models.
The current modelling capability includes strain-controlled loading using isotropic hardening/softening coupled with the mulitcomponent Armstrong-Frederick model [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/0749-6419(86)90010-0) and the Multiplicative Armstrong-Frederick model [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2008.01.001)

The modelling capability which will be supplied here will include those used in the following publications:

* [Aluminum Alloy 7075 Ratcheting and Plastic Shakedown Evaluation with the Multiplicative Armstrong–Frederick Model](https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055833)
* [A modification of the multicomponent Armstrong–Frederick model with multiplier for the enhanced simulation of aerospace aluminium elastoplasticity](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2018.05.036)

Requirements:
numpy, matplotlib, sympy
